Tested with Vagrant 1.7.4 and VirtualBox 5

### After starting the docker image or the vagrant box point your browser to

* [http://localhost:5601/app/kibana](http://localhost:5601/app/kibana) and open the "NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions" dashboard
* [http://localhost:9200/_plugin/kopf/](http://localhost:9200/_plugin/kopf/)

To see any data on the "NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions" dashboard make sure your selected time range is "Last 5 years".
The data will be indexed live when the container is running for the first time, so expect changing figures until dataload is complete.
